	<p>Steveâ€™s face was expressionless as he slammed his <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.weapon1}</span> into zombie <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.nameSomeone.capitalize()}</span>'s <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.bodyPart1}</span>. "<span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.exclamation1.capitalize()}</span>! I jammed my finger," Steve whined.
	</p>

	<p>"Oh, poor baby Stevey," Katie said mockingly from across the <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.typeOfRoom}</span> while ripping the <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.pieceOfClothing1}</span> off of the motionless zombie that used to be <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.yourName.capitalize()}</span>. "Do you think you'll make it?" Katie smiled just as zombie <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.yourName.capitalize()}</span>'s <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.bodyPart2}</span> fell off and sprayed blood all over Katie's <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.pieceOfClothing2}</span>.
	</p>

	<p>"<span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.exclamation2.capitalize()}</span>! Why can nothing of mine stay nice?! Why?!" Katie shouted angrily.
	</p>

	<p>"<span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.termEndearment.capitalize()}</span>, there are slighty more important things to worry about right now. Just slightly." Zombie <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.nameSomeone.capitalize()}</span>, weakened from the beating but still moving, <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.pastTenseVerb1}</span> and <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.pastTenseVerb2}</span> <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.adverb}</span> at Steve.
	</p>

	<p>Katie rolled her eyes, grabbed her <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.weapon2}</span> that was thick with dried zombie blood, and walked over to the window. "Yeah, I guess..." she muttered. She thought back to what she was wearing when all this started, her wedding dress, and wished that she hadn't used it to <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.violentVerb}</span> that zombie. It would be a nice comfort to her now, something special to remind her of a time before that government plane full of diseased zombie <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.pluralAnimal}</span> crashed into the Como Conservatory.
	</p>

	<p>"I wish I were still wearing it..." she said softly.
	</p>

	<p>"What did you say?" Steve asked while <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.violentVerbING}</span> zombie <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.nameSomeone.capitalize()}</span>'s <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.adjective}</span> <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.bodyPart3}</span> with his fists.
	</p>

	<p>"Nothing. I was just thinking about...my dress."
	</p>

	<p>"Oh, yeah! You totally <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.pastTenseViolentVerb}</span> that zombie with it. That was awes--WATCH OUT!" Zombie <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.yourName.capitalize()}</span>, no longer motionless, had started rapidly lunging toward them, growling and spewing blood. Steve quickly grabbed his <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.weapon1}</span>, Katie tightened her grip on the <span
		class="madLibAttribute">${madLibZombieInstance.weapon2}</span>. They looked at each other, smiled, and said in unison "Let's do this."
